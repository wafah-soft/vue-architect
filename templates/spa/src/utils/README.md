# Utils Directory

This directory contains utility functions used throughout the application.

## Current Structure (Small Project):

We are currently using a flat structure for utilities to keep things simple:

- **index.js**: Central export for all utilities.
- **otherUtilityFiles.js**: Individual utility files/functions.

## Guidelines for Scaling (Large Projects):

If this project grows in complexity or if we find the need for better organization, consider evolving into a more granular structure:

### Proposed Advanced Structure:

- **helpers/**: Utility functions that assist with specific tasks in the application, e.g., formatting data or handling user input.
  
- **lib/**: More extensive or specialized utility functions, and potentially customized third-party utilities.
  
- **functions/**: Pure, standalone functions that perform generic operations, e.g., mathematical operations or string manipulations.

### Transition Tips:

1. Migrate existing utilities to the appropriate sub-directory.
2. Update all import paths across the application.
3. Continuously review and refactor utilities to ensure they remain relevant and avoid bloat.
4. Add documentation comments for each utility to ensure clarity of purpose and usage.

## General Guidelines:

1. Ensure utility functions are pure.
2. Add comments explaining the purpose and usage of utilities.
3. Before adding a new utility, check for duplicates.
4. Discuss with the team if unsure about utility placement or structure.
