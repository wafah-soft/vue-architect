# Mixins Folder Structure

## For Small Projects

For smaller-scale projects, we utilize a straightforward structure:

```
mixins/
|-- index.js
|-- userMixin.js
|-- notificationMixin.js
|-- ... (other mixin files)
```

This keeps things simple and direct, making it easy to locate and manage mixins.

## Scaling for Larger Projects

As our project grows in complexity and size, it's essential to maintain an organized codebase. To address the growth, we propose a structured approach to organizing our mixins:

```
mixins/
|-- index.js
|-- [chosen-name]/
|   |-- userMixin.js
|   |-- notificationMixin.js
|   |-- ... (other mixin modules)
```

Replace `[chosen-name]` with a descriptor that best fits the nature of the mixins (e.g., `behaviors`, `traits`, `common`, etc.).

By categorizing mixins in this manner, we can ensure:

1. **Modularity**: Mixins related to specific functionalities or features can be grouped, providing clarity.
2. **Maintainability**: As the number of mixins grows, having them categorized can simplify maintenance tasks.
3. **Ease of Scaling**: Adding new categories or mixins becomes straightforward, without cluttering the main `mixins` directory.
